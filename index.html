            <p class="details">My name is Alejandra and I am based out of Chicago. My educational background is in Finance with a Bachelors in Business Administration from the University of Michigan, Stephen M. Ross School of Business.</p>
            <p class="details">I spent 2.5 years working on the Financial Planning and Analysis team at Target Corporation, then shifted gears to a more accounting based role on the Financial Reporting team at Illinois Tool Works. I quickly realized that I wanted a role at a smaller company where my work could truly impact the bottom line. In 2014, I began working on the Commercial Finance team at Groupon where I partnered with a GM to manage the National Business sized at approximately 83 employees and $166M in annual revenue. Soon thereafter, I realized my passion was in executing rather than planning or forecasting which is when I pivoted out of Finance and into project managing.</p>
            <p class="details">Now, I find myself digging deeper into the technical aspects of my role, working closely with product and engineering to develop the best user experience on our various platforms. This technical curiosity influenced my decision to embark on the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp journey -- so here I am trying to navigate through the world of a developer.</p>
            <p class="details">When I am not busy working or learning to code, I like to spend my time with family and friends, boxing or cycling, serving on the boards of non-profit organizations, or mentoring the youth of Chicago.  Explore my page!</p>
